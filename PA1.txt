LEFT ROTATION

	 A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements d unit to the left. 
For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array A=[1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become A=[3,4,5,1,2]. 

Given an array of n integers and a number d perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.



A NUMBER BETWEEN A AND B

	Consider two sets of positive integers, A and B. We say that a positive integer x is between sets A and B if the following conditions are satisfied:

All elements in A are factors of x.
x is a factor of all elements in B.

In other words, some x is between A and B if

x % A[i] =0 for  every element in A and
B[i] % x = 0 for every element in B.

For example, if A=[3,6] and B=[12,18], then our possible x values are 6 and 12.
Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible x's) that are between the two sets.
